# Project Revision: Image Retargeting For Visually Impaired

This project is a pioneering initiative aimed at improving the lives of individuals with Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), a degenerative eye disease affecting about 1 in 4,000 people globally. RP progressively damages photoreceptor cells in the retina, leading to night blindness, loss of peripheral vision, and eventual central vision loss. These symptoms make it increasingly difficult for RP patients to interpret and engage with visual content, hindering daily activities and independence.

Project Revision addresses these challenges by leveraging image retargeting technology to cater to the unique needs of RP patients. The project focuses on seam carving, a content-aware technique that intelligently removes non-critical visual content while preserving essential details. This results in simplified images and videos better suited to the restricted visual fields of RP patients.
